        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Algebra</h3>
            <p> The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing (Arabic: الكتاب المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-jabr wal-muqābala) is a mathematical book written approximately 820 CE</p>
          </li>

          <li> 
            <h3> Arithmetic</h3>
            <p> Al-Khwārizmī's second most influential work was on the subject of arithmetic, which survived in Latin translations but is lost in the original Arabic. His writings include the text kitāb al-ḥisāb al-hindī ('Book of Indian computation'[note 2]), and perhaps a more elementary text, kitab al-jam' wa'l-tafriq al-ḥisāb al-hindī ('Addition and subtraction in Indian arithmetic'</p>
          </li>

          <li><h3> Astronomy</h3>
            <p> Al-Khwārizmī's Zīj al-Sindhind[35] (Arabic: زيج السند هند, "astronomical tables of Siddhanta"[58]) is a work consisting of approximately 37 chapters on calendrical and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendrical, astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of sine values.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3> Trigonometry</h3>
            <p> Al-Khwārizmī's Zīj al-Sindhind also contained tables for the trigonometric functions of sines and cosine.[59] A related treatise on spherical trigonometry is also attributed to him</p> 
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3> Geography</h3>
            <p> Al-Khwārizmī's third major work is his Kitāb Ṣūrat al-Arḍ (Arabic: كتاب صورة الأرض, "Book of the Description of the Earth"),[64] also known as his Geography, which was finished in 833</p>
          </li>

          <li> <h3>Jewish Calender</h3>
            <p> Al-Khwārizmī wrote several other works including a treatise on the Hebrew calendar, titled Risāla fi istikhrāj ta'rīkh al-yahūd (Arabic: رسالة في إستخراج تأريخ اليهود, "Extraction of the Jewish Era"). It describes the Metonic cycle, a 19-year intercalation cycle; the rules for determining on what day of the week the first day of the month Tishrei shall fall.</p>
